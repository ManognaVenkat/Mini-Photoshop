# Mini-Photoshop
The primary goal of this project is to implement fundamental image processing operations, enabling users to manipulate images through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). This interface features a series of drop-down menus, under which the
core operations of the software are neatly organized.

The core functionalities of this project include: Opening and Displaying BMP Files, Grayscale Conversion, Ordered Dithering, Auto Level Adjustment, Entropy and Huffman Coding Analysis. Optional Image Manipulation Features: Additional capabilities such as rotating, flipping, adjusting brightness, and applying Gaussian blur effects are included to provide users with more creative control over their images.


# Technologies and Libraries
The project leverages Pythonv3. Key libraries utilized in the project are:

Tkinter: Python’s standard GUI library, used for creating the application’s interface.
Pillow (PIL Fork): Adds image processing capabilities, supporting various image file formats.
NumPy: Essential for high-performance mathematical operations and handling multidimensional arrays.
SciPy.stats: Provides statistical functions, used here for entropy calculation.
Collections.Counter: A dict subclass for counting hashable objects, used in frequency analysis for Huffman coding.
Heapq: A heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm
